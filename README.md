Project Type: Landing Page for Furniture
Tools Used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Description:
As a front-end developer, I meticulously crafted a captivating and user-centric landing page dedicated to showcasing a diverse range of furniture. Leveraging my expertise in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I meticulously structured the content, applied visually appealing styles, and introduced interactive elements to elevate the overall user experience.

The landing page is thoughtfully designed, ensuring seamless responsiveness across a variety of devices and screen sizes. Through the strategic use of HTML, I organized the content in an intuitive manner, allowing visitors to effortlessly explore the featured furniture products. CSS played a pivotal role in enhancing the aesthetic appeal, creating a visually pleasing environment that complements the nature of the showcased items.

To enrich the user journey, I incorporated JavaScript functionalities, leveraging popular libraries such as jQuery and Bootstrap. The inclusion of the Swiper library brought a touch of modernity, enabling smooth and eye-catching sliders to showcase multiple product images. jQuery, known for its versatility, enhanced the interactivity of the page, ensuring a dynamic and engaging experience for users.
